Python package to test tags

See https://www.tkalin.com/blog_posts/ide-like-go-to-declaration-in-vim/#comment-2134314013

This package was generated from a mrbob template. See PyPI for mr.bob, it's
just a tool to generate package boilerplate. Here's the command used:

.. code:: console

    $ mrbob bobtemplates.gillux:nspackage

The tags file was generated by executing ``ctags -R`` in the package root.
All defaults, no ctags config files. The file is generated using the 
"new extended format" (default).

.. code:: console

    $ ctags --version

If I start Vim with no plugins or config files, ``:tselect setUp`` displays::

    # pri kind tag               file
    1 F   m    setUp             tests/test_package.py
                 class:SomeTest
                 def setUp(self):
    Type number and <Enter> (empty cancels):
